# MDIA-1620
A cool repository for my MDIA 1620 class

**3 aha moments**

> 1. Clarified correct steps to navigate directory in Terminal
> 2. Understood ls allows to see what items are in the current occupied area
> 3. Have to go into the designated area where desired folder to access is. Example: if the MDIA folder you want to access is in desktop, must cd desktop, and then cd MDIA folder. Cannot jump to opening folder.

**2 things that are unlcear**
> 1. Coding language
> 2. General system of order

**Word for how you're feeling**

*Intrigued*

"git clone" - copies a version of my repository

"git status" - prints out status of local repo
